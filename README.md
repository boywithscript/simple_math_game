# üß† Math Game with Python

This is a simple math game written in Python using basic concepts like:
- `random` module
- `while` loops
- `match-case` (Python 3.10+)
- Conditional logic and input validation

## üéÆ How it works
1. The game randomly generates two numbers and an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
2. The user is asked to solve the math problem.
3. If the answer is correct (with small tolerance for division), the game shows a success message.
4. The user can choose to play again or exit.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run
```bash
python simple_math.py
